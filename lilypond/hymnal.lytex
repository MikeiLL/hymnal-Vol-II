\chapter{Introduction}

\lettrine{F}{aitheism is the philosophy} that despite the fact that God is a construct of the imagination, our spiritual convictions are nonetheless significant in navigating the vast realms of reality that are neither measurable by science nor discernible to the senses.

What is a hymn? It's a piece of music that ``everyone" can sing together. It's about our place in the universe, or God, or Our relationships with existence. It probably has a small \emph{range} of notes so that even unaccustomed voices can approximate it, following the up and down pattern of notes across the page. According to the Oxford Dictionary:

Sounds like /him/ (somehow fitting!)

noun
1A religious song or poem, typically of praise to God or a god: a Hellenistic hymn to Apollo
More example sentences Synonyms

Origin
Old English, via Latin from Greek humnos 'ode or song in praise of a god or hero', used in the Septuagint to translate various Hebrew words, and hence in the New Testament and other Christian writings.

The Septuagint (from the Latin septuaginta, "seventy") is a translation of the Hebrew Bible and some related texts into Koine Greek. As the primary Greek translation of the Old Testament, it is also called the Greek Old Testament.

What is a drone?

Okay so a hymn should probably be pretty easy to sing and even read, and by that definition only a small portion of these tunes qualify, but we're lying our way to the truth.

This is a book of songs from the musical, \underline{Are We Done Yet?} by Rivka and Mike iLL of Mad haPPy.

For anyone interested in Open Source and techie stuff, this book was assembled using Lilypond music engraving package, and \LaTeX  typesetting tool via the TeXShop interface for OSX.

This is certainly a first draft, of sorts and the songs and arrangements will surely be developed as time goes on. Our own versions of most of the tracks are usually done in harmony and this first version of the book only includes one melody for each track, usually in a range for either the male or female voice, but occasionally jumping back and forth a bit.

We hope you will feel free to play with your own harmonies, re-harmonizations, new lyrics, etc. We consider this endeavor to be in the folk tradition, and some of the melodies herein are derivative of original sources.

\section{Some Music}

Documents for \verb+lilypond-book+ may freely mix music and text.
For example,

\begin{lilypond}
\relative c' {
  c2 e2 \tuplet 3/2 { f8 a b } a2 e4
}
\end{lilypond}

Options are put in brackets.

\begin{lilypond}[fragment,quote,staffsize=26,verbatim]
  c'4 f16
\end{lilypond}

So this is the Gayatri Mantra which is supposed to be super popular. We are doing the "long" version. Interestingly I read somewhere that the "short" version preceded the "long" version, historically.

Is this another paragraph?

\lilypondfile[quote,noindent]{gayatri_mantra.ly}

A long road for us.

\lilypondfile[quote,noindent]{a_long_road.ly}

And another thing:

\lilypondfile[quote,noindent]{the_road_junction.ly}

Here's a wordless melody:
\lilypondfile[quote,noindent]{wordless-one.ly}

This next piece aims to open up the heart chakra. Anahata. 

Anubis

There's a movement that goes with it. If standing, the legs will do a basic Afro-hip-hop step of  right leg steps to the right, left leg taps down to meet it, then the opposite: ta'tha right and ta'tha left and, etc\dots For the upper body, the arms are bent, and on the up beat, they reach into the heart, pulling out cobwebs and laughy-taffy \textemdash on the down step they pull it out to the sides, opening up the ribcage and heart more and more.

The chant is this:

\lilypondfile[quote,noindent]{anahata.ly}

It is really nice to do it as a call and response where each two measures are echoed like this:

\lilypondfile[quote,noindent]{anahata_piece.ly}

The last two measures are already an echo. As with all else in this book, whatever works and we'll probably be doing it differently ourselves by the time you read this, if we're even still breathing at all.

\lilypondfile[quote,noindent]{manipura.ly}

I think the word Upanishads translates as "campfire stories". It's a collection of written documentations of ideas from the oral traditions of Hinduism. Apparently the following chant is one of the oldest texts in it. Zef and my first yoga teacher, Joe Brennan in Hoboken used to chant it at the end of every class, followed by Om, Shanti Shanti Shanti. Shanti means peace. Om is the sound of the universe beginning. Yes /textemdash in Hinduism as well, the Universe begins with a sound.

The chant means, Lead me from non-being to being. Lead me from darkness to everlasting light. Lead me from death to eternal life. Here, the chant is written as call and response, but it can also be done without the echo.

\chapter{Sweet Surrender}

A lot of these chants, like the following, have fairly generic, simple melodies. Melodies that are basically inherent in the words themselves. I was about to lead a weekly 90 minute Bhakti Yoga class and my nose started getting runny, so I did a headstand, which - after about 5 to 10 minutes gets the nose settled for an hour or so at least. I'm not sure why. Maybe Iyengar* knows. Someone (Rivka?) said he mentions the technique in Light on Yoga. 

This ``I surrender" chant felt great upside down, and I also noticed a thin layer of lint or something on the floor. Sweeping and chanting are a great combination. By the top of the hour it looked like the class was going to be a no show. I picked up the accordion, still surrendering. Lynn Jackson, a fellow bhakti practitioner showed up and we continued for about 30 minutes. It was great. After a while we started developing the text so that we could say the names of various deities and eventually we were also substituting the pronoun ``I" for the adjective ``sweet", making it ``Sweet Surrender".

Some of the Deities we called to were:

\begin{I Surrender}{\textbf{Laxmi Ma}}

\begin{I Surrender}{\textbf{Om Shiva}}

Others that come to mind are

\begin{I Surrender}{\textbf{Oshun}}

\end{I Surrender}
\begin{I Surrender}{\textbf{Om Jesus}}
This seemed like an interesting juxtaposition. I'm sure this isn't it's first time in print. The Jesus-as-deity vibe still makes me uncomfortable, not to mention that it's not the most singable word in the world.
\end{I Surrender}
