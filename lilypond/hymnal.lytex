\chapter{Forward}
Sometimes ignorance is an invitation. If I had known what I learned in the making of this hymnal prior to making it, I might not have undertaken it. The original impetus was that we wanted to talk about \emph{how} to practice some of the mantras we had recorded and were releasing as the album, \underline{Naad Your Heart}. The booklets that fit in compact discs are really awkward so we thought we'd just do a separate document. This document ended up being ninety pages, and at every turn revealed gaps in my understanding of it's content as well as implementation. It has been an insightful process.

Sacred chanting and mantra exist in many cultures, encoding many varied aspects of philosophy, faith and world view, and this first edition of the Faitheist Hymnal barely scratches the cultural surface. This is true of the spectrum of cultures, as well as within the included pantheons and cosmologies.

The Wikipedia article on chant starts by describing it as ``rhythmic speaking or singing of words or sounds". It could probably be argued that every musical chant is sacred---though some, sadly, might be in the category of evil chants. Possibly the approach that this document takes is to use music and chant as a thread through which various flavors of human spirituality and philosophy can be sewn together.

\index{datasphere}
As a composer, I have loved working with sacred texts as a pallat for melodic and/or rhythmic vocal expression. These are combinations of words so powerful that they have survived intact for generations, their potency growing with each new voice, stirring the content into the datasphere; into the collective unconscious; into our \textsc{dna}. Each mantra is like a glyph: a small package connecting and containing vast networks of information, stories, mythologies, phycological tools, scientific expression and magic.

If this work is interesting or useful to you, and I or we still exist, please feel free to reach out with questions, comments or suggestions. If the extreme limitations of the knowledge displayed herein aren't readily obvious, please take my word for it. If the vast realms of ignorance are painful, I hope you will graciously accept my apologies. \par

\chapter{Introduction}

\lettrine[lines=3, lraise=0.1, nindent=.2em, slope=-.5em]{F}{aitheism is the philosophy} that despite the fact that God is a construct of humankind, our spiritual convictions are nonetheless significant in navigating the vast realms of reality that are neither measurable by science nor discernible to the senses.
\index{Faitheism}

\index{dharma}
Do you think? No. The answer is no. The mind thinks. We each have a relationship with our mind. It's our closest relationship. If we think we \emph{are} our mind, we ignore the most significant relationship in our lives. The relationship through which we can achieve whatever freedom can be had in this life. Not freedom \emph{of} choice. Freedom \emph{from} choice. Choice is a chore performed by the mind. \emph{Intuition} is a vibration that emanates from the heart. With these chants we cultivate intuition so that rather than having to decide, we just \emph{know} what we must do. This Hindu word for the path of our destiny is called \textbf{dharma}.

\index{open source}
If she who sings prays twice, let's add movement and make it prayer squared. All praises due to the One who does not exist. The idea of God is of little use to one who sees Wow everywhere. For the rest of us, we install these open source \emph{programs} (mythologies, religions, systems) into the computers known as our minds, and run them in various configurations, learning the correct syntax to thin the fog of spiritual ignorance or at the very least make it glow a little bit so we can remember to enjoy it. So we can remember to rejoice and celebrate our apparent imperfection, and opportunity to to have a body; hands; a voice; a friend; a relationship.

\index{Bhagavad Gita}
Why do we chant, and\textemdash as we engage our hearts and cultivate devotion\textemdash  toward whom or what is that devotion aimed? In the seminal Hindu scripture, \underline{The Bhagavad Gita}, there's a line: ``Scriptures are of little value to the [one] who sees God everywhere.'' For the rest of us, there are systems, cosmologies, symbols, philosophies through which we aim to feel our way through the fog of human existence. By cultivating Awe and Faith; our Wow and our Conviction, we begin to appreciate that the fog itself is of our own making. So we chant to whomever we fancy, to whatever makes sense. Sometimes we chant trans-culturally. Hopefully always from a place of honoring, respecting and preserving traditions, even if not staying within their boundaries. In a way Faitheism is an excuse to enjoy the benefits of religion without any of the side effects. 

This work is by no means complete. To a large degree it's a tool for our own use, as a hymnal probably is by tradition. This document is designed as a tool for sharing information, but it's also a tool for storing and referencing it ourselves. The written word has made us lazy. Before writing, complete integration of a concept into the intellect was the only way to insure it's survival. Now we can write it down, put it on a shelf and forget about it. It will probably be available if we need it later. More so if we make and distribute a thousand copies of it.

With all due respect to scholars and academia, this is not a work of scholarship. I have endeavored to avoid incorrect translations and statements of fact. No guarantees. The source is an eclectic artist and friends writing back in the year twenty-sixteen.

On our particular journey, the tools that seem to be working don't all come out of the same box, or even the same house, city or continent. In the same phrase, we'll invoke Yuruba's Ogún and Jewish foremother, Esther, descendant of the Babylonian goddess, Ishtar. We sing to these two when starting out on a car trip. Ogún, a deity associated with iron and metal work, we sing to in hopes that the car will work. Esther guides the journey, controls time and always, always finds you a parking space. Asé.

What is a hymn? It's a piece of music that ``everyone'' can sing together. It's about our place in the universe, or God, or Our relationships with existence. It probably has a small \emph{range} of notes so that even unaccustomed voices can approximate it, following the up and down pattern of notes across the page.

\index{mantra}
\index{chakra}

This isn't a collection of classic or popular chants. They are mostly ones with melodies we have either written or adapted. The first section of the book has a few fairly simple, easy to learn and sing chants. Then there's a bit of discourse on vocalization methods, which includes a brief introduction to the chakra system and ways to apply it to mantra.

None of these chants require accompaniment, but in many cases we include the names of chords which we have found suitable accompaniment. Western chordal harmony is a vertical extension of melody and a relatively recent invention, with our ``just intonation'' being only a few hundred years old. Accompaniment to chant and mantra that reaches further into the infinite past would be the drone or the drum, both of which leave more room for horizontal melodic freedom.

\chapter{Some Simple Chants}

\lettrine[lines=3, lraise=0.1, nindent=.2em, slope=-.5em]{T}{he opening chants here} have small vocal ranges. Some as little as two notes a step or two apart. As the content goes on, the complexity of the included mantras increases. The first chant is the four syllables and two words repeated: Om and Śāntiḥ.

\section{Om Śāntiḥ Om}

\index{Om}
\index{microtone}
\index{śāntiḥ}
\index{step| see {interval}}
\index{interval}
\index{bījākṣara}

\mna{}{The ḥ is aspirated to match the (generally short) vowel preceding it. So it would sound like: shan \textemdash tee \textemdash hi, with the last hi being almost like an echo or reverberation.}
On the Eleventh of September, even at a time more than a decade after our beloved Manhattan and it's people suffered a terrible catastrophe, we still suffer from distress and depression. This is a mantra to use in response to such feelings. A chant in the face of our awareness of war, turmoil and violence. Śāntiḥ (\saha{शांतिः}) is a Sanskrit word meaning peace, tranquility, calmness, bliss. It sounds Shan \textemdash tee. The ḥ at the end of Śāntiḥ actually sounds kind of like a short \emph{hee} because the ḥ aspirates the vowel preceding it.  At least in some of the chant music I have seen, the syllable of the ḥ is left off. The word Shanti, spoken in an English accent, is becoming part of the ever evolving English language at this point. In Hindu and Buddhist philosophy it refers to Inner Peace, and in our culture it is often used to refer to World Peace. Om (\saha{ॐ}) is a bījākṣara (\saha{बीजाक्षर}) or \emph{seed syllable} that represents, invokes and resonates with the frequency of the universe from it's dawning, through the infinite present and until the end of time. The word is pronounced: bee \textemdash JAHK \textemdash shkah \textemdash rah. Om is a syllable and a glyph sacred with Hinduism, Bhudism, Sikhism and other religions around the world. The idea of the bījākṣara and Om are explored more fully later on. \par

\index{Third Stream}
\index{interval}
\index{blues tones}
\index{microtones}
This chant has almost as small a range as a melody can have; a single half-step interval. This means that from a physical standpoint, our throat and larynx (voice box) hardly need to move to go from one tone to the next. The interval is so small that some Western ears may have trouble distinguishing the two tones, as in our harmonic system we are more used to \emph{major} seconds or \emph{whole} steps than \emph{minor} ones. A \emph{whole} step would actually be twice as wide as a \emph{half} step and is the interval you hear between ``Happy'' and ``Birthday'' in the Birthday Song or ``Row'' and ``Your'' in Row Row Row Your Boat. For a minor second the first song that comes to mind is Stevie Wonder's \underline{Isn't She Lovely}. Other Westerners might also think of the themes from Jaws or The Pink Panther, The Beatle's \underline{Hard Day's Night} or \underline{White Christmas} by Irving Berlin. In our \emph{even tempered} system there are no measured \emph{steps} smaller than a half step, but an infinite number of frequencies exist and the voice can certainly generate them. These may be considered \emph{blues tones} or \emph{microtones}. In a chant with a tiny range like this there's a whole world of room to play around with microtones. When my friend Oren Bloedow was studying voice with renown Third Stream artist Dominique Eade, she told him to \emph{feel} rather than \emph{hear} the frequency of the voice.
\par
Sung along with a \writechord{C} drone, the tone of the chant is dark and somber, potentially evokative of the violence that permeates our culture. You could also sing the same notes with a drone of \writechord{Ab}, which would give it the tonality of the start of \underline{Isn't She Lovely}, without ever actually \emph{resolving} to ``love -- ly''. Another response to the darkness is to invite some Gods to the party, which is what we do when we either morph into or combine this chant with the following one.

\index{Kṛṣṇa}
\index{Viṣṇu}
\index{Rāma}
\index{Priya}
\index{Rāmāyaṇam}
\index{Priya}

\begin{changemargin}{-1.5cm}{-2cm} 
\lilypondfile[quote,noindent]{omshantiom_krsna.ly}
\end{changemargin}

\index{Rāmāyaṇam}
Kṛṣṇa (\saha{कृष्ण}), or Krishna is the Hindu deity we most associate with peace. Kṛṣṇa is an incarnation of Viṣṇu (\saha{विष्णु}) and considered to be the absolute essence of Viṣṇu. Priya means \emph{dear} or \emph{precious}. Rāma (\saha{राम}) or Ramachandra is an avatar of Viṣṇu; the seventh avatar, and is the protagonist in the Hindu epic the Rāmāyaṇam (\saha{रामायणम्}), or Ramayana, in which Rāma exemplifies insurpassable disciplin, spiritual devotion and surrender and generally being completely attuned to the path of our ultimate destiny. We invoke Rāma here in the spirit of the famous Hare Kṛṣṇa chant popularized around the world through the Kṛṣṇa Consciousness movement.

If someone's feeling inspired the following might also be added to the mix. Nothing here is written in stone. Far from it. More like crayon. We like to sing---or rather sing for our sanity---and are building up a collection of chants and mantras that don't require too much thought and don't make us cringe too much in their content. So if singing Hail Kṛṣṇa makes you cringe, by all means Hail Vodka! Whatever works.

\index{minor}
\index{major}
\index{śāntiḥ}

Following is a fun scale that works along with the base Om Śāntiḥ Om chant. It's a \emph{minor} scale, which simply means that the third scale tone is \emph{minor}: \emph{one whole step} and \emph{one half step} above the \textbf{main} or \textbf{tonic} note (The \textbf{tonic} is the note that is the \emph{key} we are in, which is \writechord{C} in this case.) is played or sung, as opposed to the \emph{major third} which is \emph{two whole steps} (four half steps, or \emph{semitones}) above the \textbf{tonic}.

\vspace*{-.2in}
\begin{changemargin}{-1cm}{-1cm} 
\lilypondfile[quote,noindent]{omshantiom_scale.ly}
\end{changemargin}
\vspace*{-.2in}

See that it has the \writechord{Eb} in it. In the Kṛṣṇa chant above, the \emph{major} third is sung (\writechord{E}), which might be dissonant or discordant next to the  \writechord{Eb}, in which case you could change the scale and substitute the \writechord{Eb} with an E\natural   (natural\textemdash the white note two steps above \writechord{C}), making the tonality \emph{major}.

\index{interval}

\mna{In relation to tonality, an \emph{interval} is the distance between two notes or frequencies.}
\index{augmented second}
\index{semitone}
In either case the scale contains one interval that is evokative of Eastern tonalities, and that is the \emph{augmented second}. An augmented second has the same acoustical qualities as a minor third in that there are \emph{one whole step} and \emph{one half step} or {three semitones} between the two notes. However in this case there isn't a note between them in the scale, which is why it is referred to as a second and not a third. A ``first" would be a non-step, second is a single (whole, half or augmented) step, third is two steps, fourth is three steps and so on. 

\section{Asato Ma}

\index{śāntiḥ}

I think the word Upanishads translates as ``to sit near". It's a collection of written documentations of ideas from the oral traditions of Hinduism. Each would be a long teaching going deeper and deeper toward a a revealed reality which is the secret teaching the story is intended to reveal. Apparently the following chant is one of the oldest texts in it. Joe Brennan, the first yoga teacher of Emilio ``Zef" China and myself in Hoboken used to chant it at the end of every class, followed by Om, Śāntiḥ Śāntiḥ Śāntiḥ. Shanti means peace. Om is the sound of the universe beginning. Yes\textemdash in Hinduism as well, the Universe begins with a sound.

The chant means, Lead me from non-being to being. Lead me from darkness to immortality or non-death. Lead me from death to eternal life. Here, the chant is written as call and response, but it can also be done without the echo.

\section{Anatomy of Drone}

\index{Zef}
Emilio ``Zef Noi\$e" China is pretty experienced at creating drones, and much of the following is his writing. Drone is the pure rhythm; the pure time. The drone of our blood running through our veins. The drone of our mothers heart beat. Ohm (\saha{ॐ}). The beginning of the universe. An echo of God's initial and eternal statement. (All Praises Due to the One Who Does Not Exist.)  \par

Forever itself is a massive vibration of time and space. That which is; that which has been and always will be. Repetition, vibration as in nature, self replication, echo, reverberation, integrate and disintegrate. Primal expression of the creative principle. All notes surely are contained in the one sound. As above so below. This is the groove. This is the drone.

\index{bījākṣara}
\mna{The Big Bang the Divine or original intonation that as The mother goddess creates and destroys all things in a breath, through the sound of her voice. \textemdash Zef Noi\$e}

The chanting and repetition of Divine names; of majikal syllables, bījākṣara (\saha{बीजाक्षर}) is itself a drone. The music of the spheres. Each planet vibrates at it's own frequency. Prior to the 16ht century, in the West, the harmonic system of Pythagoras\textemdash the divine order of the frequencies, based on the 3:2 logarithm found in the natural fifth\textemdash was our harmonic foundation. Then a man named Werkmeister developed the even tempered system. Major thirds, for example, don't sound as dissonant, but our music is out of tune with the universe. It's convenient. \par

Repetitive waves of sound. One key, one mono, one love. Unity. Minimalism. Simplicity of action exposes the complexity of nature. Less is more. Do less and less to achieve more and more until you do nothing and achieve everything.

So how do you make a drone? One doesn't make a drone. It may appear that one has made a drone, but what one has done is add to a drone that was always there. So if you want to add to the drone, start by listening to it.  If there is a string stretched somewhere, you can cause it to vibrate, and if it is near a resonant box, the vibrations of the string will cause the surrounding air to vibrate and those sound waves will be amplified by the resonant box. Piano, guitar, violin, banjo exhibit this principle. Blowing through a reed creates audible sound waves. You can download a free application that creates an imitation of the Tanpura drone ubiquitous in Indian music. A nearby train yard or a factory may be emitting a drone like that of an electronic oscillator\textemdash sine, pulse, sawtooth or triangle wave\textemdash which could be filtered or combined with an audio synthesizer. An electronic drone can be created by leaning an electric guitar against the amplifier it's plugged into. Electronic echo and delay units may create layers upon layers of a single sound upon itself like layers of overlapping time in the onion of infinity.

Take a deep breath. Fill the lungs. Vibrate the vocal chords and allow the naturally resulting tone to be carried out on the breath, the prana\textemdash cosmic energy \textemdash resonating in the box we call the human torso. Vibrating with the universe. Remember, as my friend Garret Pengle says, that we are each a continuation of the explosion that started the universe.

Sustainer. Enlightener. Liberator. Infinite. Destroyer. Creator. Nameless. Desireless.
Move the awareness -- and the resonance of the voice -- up through the seven primary chakras as the mantra is chanted. Chakras are discussed in more detail later on, and listed in the index.

\begin{itemize}
 \item  \textbf{Root Chakra} RED --- Gobinday --- \emph{Sustainer}
 \item  \textbf{Naval Chakra} ORANGE --- Mukanday --- \emph{Liberator}

The two voices documented above cross between the lower and higher parts (see how the stems of the notes make those odd squares at the beginning, but not at the end?), but this is how the piece developed and we like the way it sounds. The most complicated aspect of this chant\textemdash  from a musical standpoint\textemdash  is probably the rhythm found in the first measure and repeated in the third, fifth and thirteenth measures. Determining a measure that fit the way Rivka was chanting the mantra was a bit of a challenge. One way to figure out complex or syncopated rhythms is to break the rhythm down and apply a time-grid to it. In the Nigerian language, Yuruba, the word for time is \textbf{agogô}, and the bells used to define time in music (which you hear commonly generating their two tones in Western dance music: gong\textemdash ging\textemdash ging-gong\textemdash gong\textemdash  ging-ging\textemdash  gong\textemdash gong) are called A-go-go bells. Rhythm is the breaking up or dissecting of time. Pretty cool magical skill. Here in measure one the smallest part of the beat is a sixteenth note. It's the third note in the measure and has a double flag on it's stem. The time signature, 3/4 means there are three quarter notes to a measure, which equals six eighth notes or twelve sixteenth notes. The first two notes are ``tied" together with those nice arcs, creating a single tone with the duration of a quarter note, which is the length of four 16th notes, and a \emph{dotted eighth note}. A dot at the end of a note means you add another half of it's rhythmic value to it. So a dotted eighth note is an eighth note plus a sixteenth note\textemdash  or three sixteenth notes. So altogether the two tied notes equal seven beats. Then the sixteenth note that the syllable `bin' (Gobinday) occurs on gets three sixteenths before sliding up for the last two sixteenths of the twelve-sixteenth equals six-eighth equals three-quarter note measure. Another, possibly simpler way to get it is to just square it off to the nearest eighth notes\textemdash  at first holding `Go' for two (quarter notes) and `bin' for one. Then just see if you can \emph{anticipate} `bin' by just a hair.

There was a period where I'm fairly sure I made our housemate (and dear friend) Madeline Tharp sorry she had said the noise didn't bother her at all with a regular pre-sunrise ecstatic chanting practice. I would begin by just engaging the diaphragm and voice box slightly, generating a low growl, and slowly stretch further into various tones, phrases, vibrations. Sometimes words would come.

It would be great to develop something more adventurous at some point, possibly along the lines of George Russel's Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization. It's basic idea is that the interval of the ``perfect'' fourth creates a tonal polarity, while the Lydian scale, which has a ``sharp" fourth, is in tune with the natural gravitational structure of tonal harmonics. When George Russel spent time in a hospital he developed the concept into a full fledged method of tonal organization with measured degrees of \emph{gravitational} distance from a tonal center.}

\index{gurmukhī}
\index{sikh}
Where Sanskrit is the primary language of Hindu chants, Kundalini Yoga chants are typically in \textbf{Gurmukhī} (\textpunjabi{ਗੁਰਮੁਖੀ}), a language that combines Punjabi and Sanskrit.


It is the tongue of the \textbf{Sikh} religion. The name Gurmukhi means ``from the mouth of the Guru'' and comes from the Old Punjabi word guramukhī.

\index{easy pose}
\index{sukhasana}

\mna{Easy Pose, also called \textbf{sukhasana} is how yoga describes sitting cross-legged, like the way we describe First Nations people around a fire.}

This is a healing chant, which can be performed seated in easy pose with the upper arms and elbows tucked into the sides of the ribcage, the arms bent at the elbows, fingers pointed outwards at a 45 degree angle to the center of the body - almost hyperextended in the wrists, palms open to the sky with fingers together and thumbs open.

The words, \textbf{Ra Ma Da Sa Sa Say So Hung} mean Sun, Moon, Earth, Infinity, Infinity, I am Thou. The first infinity, \textbf{Sa} refers to \emph{impersonal} or \emph{astrological infinity}, and \textbf{Say} is the \emph{personal} manifestation of \emph{infinity}, or the \emph{personal embodiment} of \textbf{Sa} (we are each a microcosm of the universe), so the two syllables together: \textbf{Sa Say} is the \emph{otality of infinity}, which includes the \emph{Cosmic Intelligence} (to which we have and seek access). \textbf{Ra Ma Da Sa}, known by itself as the \emph{Earth Mantra}, is made up of syllables which mean Sun, Moon, Earth, Infinity. \textbf{Sa Say So Hung} is the \emph{Ether Mantra}. The syllable \textbf{So} captures a \emph{personal sense of unity with the divine}, and \textbf{Hung} is the \emph{vibrating, energetic reality of the Infinite}. 
\index{Ravi Singh}
Ravi Singh describes the difference between Sa and Hung as follows: ``Sa is Existence itself and Hung means the realization or manifestation of that. Sa is light and Hung is the laser form of that light."

Each round of the chant is performed with a single breath, the final syllable, Hung being more gasped than sung, emphasized as the last bit of breath is pushed out by energetically pulling in on the naval.

By great fortune our local radical book store Open Books had a copy of \underline{The Shambhala Guide to Sufism}. Author Carl W. Ernst translates and describes one application of this ubiquitous Sufi chant. The meaning of the words is as follows: There is no God but God. The visualization Ernst describes is that the adept (that's you) repeats the first part, ``there is no God", visualizing the body disappearing from the bottom up. Then as we (that's you) chant ``but God", the Heart becomes and expansive light that fills the universe. The idea as I understand it is that our \emph{concept} of god (ilāha) interferes with our relationship with a cosmic \emph{actuality} (allāh) that is beyond logic, intellectual comprehension or description.

The chant starts with a four count breath, represented by the rest at the end of the music. The dots below some of the notes represent \textbf{staccato} rendering which means the note should be sharply detached or separated from the others. \textbf{Ek} is sung this way, with energy focused---as Arjan Singh clarified for us---at the back of the Root Chakra, the the coccyx or tailbone. Move the energetic focus to the front of the Root Chakra in the genital and frontal pelvic region for \textbf{Ong}, and still with the same breath, \textbf{Kar}, at the Naval, holding both syllables held for six counts, followed by another four count breath. \textbf{Sat} is powerful and staccato, resonating in the Solar region\textemdash center of power and will\textemdash and \textbf{Nam} resonates at the Heart Center\textemdash Anahata\textemdash for twelve counts. With the last fraction of remaining breath we evoke \textbf{Siri}\textemdash greatness and beyond\textemdash then a breath and another staccato syllable, \textbf{Wa} \textemdash at the first eye\textemdash followed by a short half-inhalation, \textbf{He} at the crown and \textbf{Guru} rising up into infinity.

The meaning of the text is as potent as the chords are elementary. Ang means \emph{all}, Sung means \emph{in every}, Wahe is \emph{wow} and Guru, \emph{teacher}. All In Every Wow Teacher. Guru also means, according to Iyengar, Darkness (Gu) to Light (Ru). There's an idea that each one of us, and indeed everything in the universe is a microcosm of the entire universe. So we're steeping in the concept that All is In Every Part. Wow, my teacher. All of our learning and understanding comes out of Wow. Comes our of Awe, which we cultivate.

There's also some slight movement at the \writechord{E7}, but it's well within the borders of harmonically conservative. However, chanting is medicinal. It's an antidote for hereditary depression, alcoholism, PTSD, lack of grounding and a host of other ailments. As long as it's effective, so what if medicine tastes a little like cheeze wiz?

Lakṣmī (\saha{लक्ष्मी}) is Hindu goddess of abundance and feminine aspect of Narayana, out of whom existence is said to have been born. Sarasvatī (\saha{सरस्वती}) is a goddess who's history goes back much further into the Vedic period\textemdash and later considered by some to be a manifestation of Lakṣmī\textemdash through whom the art of mantra is said to be, according to Hindu tradition, disseminated to humankind. Sarasvatī is goddess of learning and also the name of a legendary river in India which has now disappeared.

\index{Hinduism}
\index{Tantra}

In India, it was the philosophy of \textbf{Tantra} (\saha{तंत्र}), dawning around the 5th century c.e., which moved from the view of the physical body as an obstruction to spirituality to the consideration of the body as a physical manifestation of the spirit. The practitioners of Tantra were apart from society and engaged in some fairly eccentric practices: carrying staffs with skulls on top, wearing earrings, smearing themselves with ashes from the cremation pyres and including sexual engagement in their worship to name a few. Tantra came to it's full flowering in the 9th century with the Nath tradition, in which it was believed that an idealized body could become divine and achieve immortality.

\index{Swami Svatmarama}
\index{hatha}
\index{Haṭha Yoga Pradipika}

It is out of this philosophy that what we know as Haṭha yoga formed. A literal translation of haṭha is \emph{force} or \emph{exertion} and it refers to the yogic practices as outlined in a text called the \underline{Haṭha Yoga Pradipika}, written around 1500 c.e. by a yogi named Swami Svatmarama.

\index{sympathetic majick}

There's an idea that if we follow the mind back to it's source, we find God. And we also see that as each one of us is a microcosm of the universe, by exploring the physical, logical, emotional and psychological limits of our selves, we are exploring the limits of the universe. This also applies to our use of vocalization. We use the voice to explore the universe. Most if not all spiritual traditions embrace and express the idea that God listens not necessarily to the words, but to the intention behind the words. In \textbf{Hinduism} as well as in \textbf{Ifá} there are words used in incantations that dont't have any literal meaning. Sounds that resonate or vibrate with specific \textbf{oriṣa} (diety) or aspects of nature and consciousness. In Western occult terms this may be referred to as Sympathetic Majick.

\index{Aleister Crowley}
\index{sakr}
\index{bhakti}

Aleister Crowley suggests that, ``True religion is intoxication'', and that ``all acts which excite the divine in [us] are proper to the rite of invocation". Sufi tradition echoes this sentiment in it's traditional spiritual metaphors of ``wine" and ``intoxication" or \textbf{sakr} (\textarabic{صقر}) as states of divine bliss and at the very least departure from the realm of rationality. We can also achieve states of spiritual bliss through song. In yogic terms this is an aspect of the \textbf{bhakti} (\saha{भक्ति}) tradition or the yoga of \emph{devotion}. It is the soul's voicing of it's aspiration.

\index{grounded}
\index{centering}
\index{Rivka}
When we sing, we want to vocalize from a place of being grounded. We want the \emph{body} of our voice to come straight up through us from the Earth below. I have learned a lot about physicality and the facilities of the body from Rivka and asked her to talk a bit about centering.

\epigraph{Taking classes and studying meditation I was always trying to \emph{visualize} the Chakras, visualize myself becoming centered. I realized that centering is this thing that I've been able to do since I was a child. There's some part of me --- maybe it's my awareness --- that might be described as floating. And I can draw that part of myself into my physical body --- deeper than any actual part of the body --- into an obtuse, undefinable center, and become grounded and centered.\par

And when I do that --- take the time to center myself --- I am able to manage the emotions that arise throughout the activity and interactivity of the day. If not, they are likely to be storm winds, my moods, a ship tossed in the waves.}{Rivka, \emph{The Book of Rivka}}

How do we use our voice? What physical processes are occurring when we vocalize, chant and sing? How can we generate frequencies that will be spiritually potent and most importantly rewarding, rejuvenating and cathartic for us. Like in much of yoga we combine, blend and balance \emph{force} and \emph{surrender}, \emph{intuition} and \emph{intellect}, \emph{vacuity} and \emph{visualization}. Depending on the volume and frequency we aim to vocalize, we may be engaging different parts of the body in different ways.

\section{Chakras}

\index{chakra}
\index{mudrā}

\index{Nancy LaNasa}
The word \textbf{chakra} (\saha{चक्र}) translates as \emph{circle} or \emph{wheel} and the chakra system refers to energy centers. We grew up pronouncing the word with a soft ``\textsc{ch}", but apparently that would refer to some kind of pickle, so now we pronounce chakra like chocolate. Thank you Nancy LaNasa for clearing that up. There are various ideas about where the primary energy centers in the body are, whether they are called chakras or by other names. I'm told that the original system from Buddhist and Hindu tradition is a system that associates colors with the lower 5 of seven chakras, the colors being Gold at the root, Clear or White (the milk of \textbf{Viṣṇu} \saha{विष्णु}), Red at the solar plexus, Green at the heart and Blue or Black at the throat. The ``new age'' system included here is quite popular and it's colors correspond with the colors of the rainbow. Less interesting and it doesn't really make sense to me that the frequencies of light at which the chakras resonate would happen to correspond with the way our eyes happen to perceive light as it separates, but it's a simple way to memorize and visualize these energy centers. There's a Wikipedia page on it which is quite well put together. \par

\index{anāhata}
\index{maṇipūra}
In her wonderful book \underline{India: A Sacred Geography}, Diana L. Eck offers a few tips on how to pronounce sanskrit words, which I'll paraphrase here. \textbf{A} sounds like \emph{uh}, as in \emph{allow}. \textbf{Ā} sounds like \emph{father}. \textbf{I} as in \emph{it}. \textbf{Ī} is like \emph{magazine}. \textbf{U} as in \emph{put} and \textbf{Ū} like in \emph{rude}. The \textbf{ṣ} (retroflex ``s" sounds like \emph{sheep}. Consonants followed by an ``h"---aspirated consonants---include ``bh", ``dh" and ``th", which sound like the way those letters combine in \emph{clubhouse}, \emph{bloodhound} and \emph{hothouse} and would be found in a word like svādhiṣṭhāna. The letters written with a ``v" are soft like a ``w": Swad---hee---sht-han---uh.

Eck goes on to offer some rules of thumb. In two-syllable words like \textbf{Śi}va and \textbf{Viṣ}nu, the accent will be on the first syllable. In longer words, the penultimate syllable is accented \emph{if} it contains a long vowel like in mūlā\textbf{dhā}ra or maṇi\textbf{pū}ra (or a dipthong). In most other words the accent can be expected to be in the third from last, or antepenultimate syllable: A\textbf{nā}hata.

\mna{From Hindu and Buddhist tradition, a \textbf{mudrā} (/mu'drɑ:/ Tibetan: \texttibetan{ཕྱག་རྒྱ་}) is an energetic ``seal'', ``mark''; a symbolic or ritual ``gesture''. Some mudrās involve the entire body; mostly just hands and fingers.}

\textbf{Mūlādhāra} (\saha{मूलाधार})\textemdash pronounced mewl ah  dAh dah\textemdash is the root chakra. It's our connection to the Earth; our groundedness. We associate each of these seven primary chakras with the colors starting at the root with red. This slowly spinning wheel is in the region of the groin and pelvis. When we squeeze in on the basket of muscles in the pelvic basin it is referred to as Mūlā Bandha (\saha{मूलबंध}), root lock or root lift. These are the same muscles we engage when controlling our bowels or urethra trying to ``contain ourselves''.

The syllable associated with Mūlādhāra is \textbf{Lam} and an associated mudrā (\saha{मुद्रा}) is the index and middle fingers making a ``peace sign'' and touching the ground.
\index{kundalini}
When we vocalize, we want this region to be relaxed and settled towards the earth, but engaged enough so that we're not collapsing or slouching in the pelvic region. The base of the spine, where the coiled serpent of latent kundalini energy is said to reside, is in this Mūlādhāra region. Take a deep breath and exhale slowly, visualizing the energy of Mūlādhāra rising up through the spine and torso as light and emerging from the mouth, first eye or crown of the head. Now do the same thing, but this time engage the larynx or voice box, which are elastic \emph{chords} that vibrate like reeds in the wind to create a tone, and imagine the sonic vibration originating in the pelvis, moving up and out, filling the room with sound and energy.

You did this. You create this vibration. Wow. Nice to have a body. All praises due to The One Who Does Not Exist.

\index{svādhiṣṭhāna}
\index{mudrā}


\textbf{Svādhiṣṭhāna} (\saha{स्वाधिष्ठान}) --- pronounced swad eeh shtAh nuh --- is the center of our creativity, sexuality. It's located in the naval region and at the sacrum at the base of the spine. Our belly button is a scar at the point where for the beginning of our physical existence we took in all of our food and oxygen. The color we visualize here is orange.

\index{diaphragm}

This is a significant region in vocalizing because it is generally through engaging the abdominal muscles that we become in touch with our diaphragm. The diaphragm is a trampoline-shaped muscle with high elasticity that separates the thoracic or chest cavity from the abdominal area. When we inhale it stretches down into the abdominal cavity, moving the organs out toward the belly sides and back, and creating more space for the lungs to expand. On exhalation the diaphragm springs back into it's contracted shape, pushing the air --- the air upon which our vocal tone rides -- out through the throat.
\index{qi}
\index{prana}
Vajroli mudrā is associated with Svādhiṣṭhāna and I've seen it's description ranging from engaging the genital muscles and drawing upward to the kundalini practice of ``drinking'' milk into the erect penis from a cup in the aim to be able to ejaculate, then draw all of the semen back into the penis so as not to lose any of the \emph{life energy}, \textbf{prana} or what in Chinese culture is called \textbf{Qi} (氣), pronounced ``chee", like cheese.

A hand mudrā is to, in each hand, to extend the pinky and ring finger, fold the thumb into the palm and wrap index and middle fingers over the thumb. Now, in front of the chest the hands meet with the extended pinky and ring fingertips pressed together and the knuckles of the index and middle either meeting or separated.

The syllable associated with Svādhiṣṭhāna is \textbf{Vam}, and color is yellow.

\index{maṇipūra} 
\index{nāḍī}
\index{mudrā}


\textbf{Maṇipūra} (\saha{मणिपूर}) Maah nee pOOh dah. This is the solar region or the area of the solar plexus, which is the soft cavity just below the breast plate below where the lowermost ribs meet at the top center of the abdomen. It's is where 72,000 Nāḍī (\saha{नाडी})---which translates as \emph{nerve} and are describes as energetic \emph{channels}---come together and in Western anatomy is described as a cluster of nerves in front of the diaphragm. Ravi Singh describes it as the center of our will. ``Forego a fate", he used to say, ``in favor of a destiny.''

\index{śakti}
\index{har}
\index{mudrā}
\index{kundalini}

A couple of good exercises to develop the maṇipūra chakra: The kundalini yoga practice of kneeling, settled onto your chins and pulling in on the abdomen as you chant the name for the energetic (and feminine, śakti) form of divinity: \emph{Har}, letting the air replenish itself solely from the elastic reflex of the diaphragm --- without active inhalation. Kundalini tradition recommends durations including three, eleven and thirty-one minutes.

There is also \textbf{kapalabhati prāṇāyāma} (\saha{कपालभाति प्राणायाम}), which are two combined words, the first set being \emph{kapal} which means skull, and \emph{bhati} which means shining or illuminating. The word \textbf{prāṇā} refers to one of the most significant concepts in the eastern traditions we've been so extensively drawing from and exploring here. We generally translate prāṇā to mean breath, but it also translates as life force and Iyengar writes that the closest phrase we have for prāṇā in English is, Holy Spirit. \emph{Yāma} means control. In this prāṇāyāma---or breath control---exercise called shining skull, we push air out with short diaphragmatic (and/or abdominal) flexes, then release the diaphragm (at first just focus on the abdominal muscles, which are easier to engage directly) and allow the vacuum of the lungs to drink in the precious breath reflexively and without conscious effort. This is often measured by placing one palm on the lower abdomen and observing as it contracts, moving inward when you flex the air out, then returns outward and forward when the diaphragm returns (up) to it's relaxed position. The mouth is gently closed so that---as you hopefully always do---the breath enters and exits through the filtration system of the nostrils and sinuses.

\index{anāhata}
\index{mudrā}
\index{yam}

\textbf{Anāhata} (\saha{अनाहत}) Ah NAAh Hot ah. Unstruck sound. The sound of the celestial realm. Not having a beginning, it has no end. This is the heart center. The color of Anāhata is green. The color of life, spring and compassion as well as anger. The thrust of Anāhata is upwards. Growth. The syllable is \textbf{Yam}. It is in the thoracic or chest cavity that the tone of our voice, both in speech of song, resonates. It is the heart center we engage when we put emotion into our devotion. Put some heart into it.

A mudrā for the heart, performed at \emph{heart center} in front of the breast plate, is to form a lotus flower shape by placing the side of the thumb and pinky fingertips as well as bottom of the palms together and extend the fingers heavenward. One of the symbolic meanings of the lotus flower is that something of exquisit beauty grows out of what appears to us as darkness and muck.

Exercises for the heart are backbends and anything that opens up the chest. A simple kundalini warm up is to kneel, sitting on the chins, and rotate the top of the hips forward, extending the heart on the inhale, then arch the back, rotating the pelvis back and pulling the heart \emph{into the past} on the exhalation.

\textbf{Viśuddha} (\saha{विशुद्ध}) Vee shOO duh. Also pronounced Vee shOO dee (Viśuddhi). At the throat. Just before Lakṣmī	(\saha{लक्ष्मी}) emerged from the sea of consciousness; the sea of milk, when all of the demons and celestial beings were cooperating (in Ifa tradition there is a phrase, \emph{awo ibaşepò} which refers to the \emph{mystery of cooperation}) in it's churning to raise \emph{amrit} ({\saha{अमृत}) --- the nectar of immortality (and bliss) --- the magnificently brilliant blue Kaustubha (\saha{कौस्तुभ:}) gem floated out and into the throat of Viṣṇu (\saha{विष्णु}), who immediately began to emote divine truth.

The color of course is blue, consistent with the earlier system. Viśuddha is the center of communication. Ear, nose and throat all being connected, it's the center of speaking \emph{and} of listening, hearing. 

\index{bījākṣara}
\index{ham}
\index{granthita mudrā}
Viśuddha's \emph{bījākṣara} (\saha{बीजाक्षर}) or seed syllable is \textbf{Ham} and an associated mudrā, called \emph{granthita mudrā} is performed by interlocking the pinky, ring and middle fingers like one would if doing the ``here is the church and here is the steeple'' game, then creating two interlocking circles with the thumb and index fingers. The mudrã is held to the base of the throat, elbows resting on the chest. Granthita \emph{might} mean \emph{redemption}, but that is unconfirmed.


\index{camel pose}
\index{ustrasana}
\index{ājñā}
\index{mudrā}

To open and engage the viśuddha chakra, we want to draw blood to the area. A couple of poses that are great for that---briefly---are \textbf{camel pose} or \emph{uṣṭrāsana} (\saha{उष्ट्रासन}), in which one is kneeling with feet flexed and toe mounds on the ground; using the palms---fingers facing downward---against the buttocks for support, the pelvis is reaching forward with the tail bone lengthening down, chest is stretched wide, cervical spine and entire neck and throat are \emph{extended} (not hinged) open and \emph{back}, the gaze is up toward the heavens or potentially gazing back toward the ãjñā; deep breathing through the nose. An extension of this pose, which also loosens up phlegm in the lungs, is to open the mouth as wide as possible, extend the tongue as far as possible, and forcefully fill and empty the lungs. Another exercise is the kundalini practice of energetically pressing the tongue against one side of the mouth, pushing the cheek out, and circling the tongue. It doesn't take long before blood cells are racing into the tongue and throat area, great heat (and apparent discomfort) are being generated, and the movements of the tongue become more spasmodic than fluid.

\textbf{Ājñā} (\saha{आज्ञा}) Aj nee yá. The center of perception. The first (or third) eye. In Ifá there is also a system of energy centers in the body called \textbf{àwúję}. The àwúję which Awo Fá'lokun Fatunmbi says corresponds with the human connection to the \emph{orisha consciousness} is called the \textbf{ìwúję} and is, like the ãjñā, situated between and above the blinking eyes, only the ìwúję is in the center for the forehead, where as the ãjñā is said to be at the center of the brow, corresponding to the pineal gland. Iya Monifay, an esteemed local Ifà priestess says that it is the \textbf{orí}, situated at the crown, which is the connection to \emph{orisha consciousness}, while the \textbf{ìwúję}, like the ãjñā, is the center of perception. This is the point at which the two largest nāḍī, \textbf{Idā} (\saha{इडा}) and \textbf{Piṅgala} (\saha{पिंगला}), the masculine and feminin, solar/lunar, conscious/energetic channels converge---the two serpents who's tails begin in our tailbone at the seat of kundalini energy---having intertwined up the spine, generating our dynamism.

Om (\saha{ॐ}) is the syllable of ãjñā. The color in the original system was no color. In the ``new age'' system it's indigo, a deep, purplish blue. The mudrā of the ``great head'' is performed by curling the ring finger into the palm and bringing the tips of the extended thumb, index, middle fingers and pinky together at the ãjñā; first eye.

\index{ori}
\textbf{Sahasrāra} (\saha{सहस्रार}) Sah has rAh ra. Thousand petaled lotus at the crown of the head. Our connection to the divine. Rand Hicks from the Integral Knowledge Study Center in Pensacola explains that historically, a hundred---a hundred sheep---someone who had a hundred sheep---that's a lot of sheep! But a thousand? A thousand is infinite. We can't see a thousand. We can break it up into theoretical pieces, but as a unit, it just goes on and on. 
\index{mudrā}
Sahasrāra is the seventh chakra. It's color, if any color at all, is said here to be violet. A soft, light pinkish purple. Or maybe white. The syllable is the silent Om. A mudrā is to create a pyramidal shape by extending the thumb and pointer fingers, palms faced away from the body, with their very tips connecting. The rest of the fingers create rays or petals. It is of course called the thousand petalled mudrā. Hold this mudrā five or six inches above the crown.

Where the low and middle parts of our voices resonate in the thoracic (chest) cavity, the high frequencies vibrate in the skull, what \textbf{Ifá} calls the \textbf{ori}.

\index{soft palate}

From bottom to top, our voice draws it's earthiness from the base of the pelvis, where we are settled into the gentle pull of gravity. The \emph{support}---so that we're not straining our throat to create sound, but merely \emph{allowing} it to pass---begins with a gentle lift in the mūlādhāra. We monitor our breath, the intake of prana and the exhalations upon which the tones are carried forth, at the svādhiṣṭhāna; the naval center; apex of our creativity, sex and sensuality. The abdomen expands as breath enters the body and contracts (draws inward) as it moves out. This is handled by the diaphragm, right behind the maṇipūra---the center of will---at the solar plexus. The voice box or vocal chords are located in the throat (viśuddha), stretched across the larynx; reeds which vibrate, creating and modifying the tone created by the passing breath, but their tone \emph{resonates} in the chest (anāhata), and head (ãjñā, sahasrāra). We want the throat to be stretched open like a yawn or a Wow! The tongue is relaxed, flat and forward so as not to block passage of breath and tone through the throat. The \emph{soft palate} at the back of the mouths roof is sprung open like an umbrella, as if making room like a snake swallowing an animal.
\index{Om}
\index{tide of Oms}
Om can be practiced moving from a lower note on an Ah sound, visualized as beginning at the root, then moving up through the chakras through more of an Oh vowel tone in the solar and heart region, and Ooh in the throat and first eye and finally Mmmm resonating and vibrating each of the thousand (infinite) petals of the sahasrāra. When Om-ing in a group, the length of each Om can coincide with the breath of each participant, so that the shape of each one is timed differently, coming in like waves of the tide. A tide of Oms.

\chapter{Chakra Mantras}

\lettrine[lines=3, lraise=0.1, nindent=.2em, slope=-.5em]{W}{hen learning the Sanskrit names} of the chakras and their corresponding seed syllables, I made up some simple chants which are included here.

In and of itself, I'm not terribly interested in this mantra, but as far as memorizing the sanskrit name of the chakra and it's associated bījākṣara it did the trick. \par

\index{lam}
\index{mūlādhāra}
What I really dig in terms of a mūlādhāra mantra is this: Find a comfortable seated position on the ground. Now with the two hands, fold the pinky and ring finger in to the palm and hold with the thumb, extending the ring and middle (Jupiter and Saturn, respectively) fingers creating what is at the time of this writing considered a ``peace sign". With straight arms, touch the ground with the ends (tips or pads, I guess) of the extended Jupiter and Saturn fingers and in the lowest voice possible, chant the sacred syllable, \textbf{Lam} for a second or so and repeat for about 45 minutes\textemdash or maybe one to ten minutes.

\index{ocean}
As with all of the chakras, we might consciously, unconsciously and anatomically hinder svādhiṣṭhāna, which can manifest in limitions on our creativity and sexuality, as well as sensuality and other aspects of the living experience.\par
The following mantra is meant to be visualized as originating in the naval area, and expanding outward as the melody expands. For movement, begin with the hands gently and sensuously encircling the top of the hips and waist, alternately bend the knees, which guides the hips to either side. The pace of the movement matches the half notes in the mantra so Vam\textemdash  Left; Vam\textemdash  Right; Svādhiṣ\textemdash  Left; thana\textemdash  Left etc\ldots.\par
As the mantra continues, the eyes may be closed, bringing the attention further inward, and the hands may begin to move about. Possibly the thumbs and pointer fingers will make a circle around the belly button, touching at the tips. Maybe the hands will move out to either side like palm leaves blowing in the wind, visualizing a tropical beach at the edge of a river or the ocean and possibly one of the many Love Goddesses dancing with you. Maybe you are in a large group of dancers. Maybe becoming one with the Ocean. It may be sunrise or sunset, both of which generate the Orange color associated with svādhiṣṭhāna.

With this chant we place the open palms over the solar plexus\textemdash the manipura\textemdash center of the self, where 72,000 nerves come together and rock lightly back and forth, shifting from one foot to the other at half the speed of the rocking. Rocking happens at a quarter note pulse and shifting feet at half-notes, two to the measure.

Anubis is the Jackyl-headed god of the dead in Egyptian mythology. Anubis puts the heart of the newly dead being on a scale, weighing it against the weight of a feather, and we're looking for the feather to be the heavier of the two.

There's a movement that goes with this heart-lightening chant. If standing, the legs will do a basic Afro-hip-hop step of  right leg steps to the right, left leg taps down to meet it, then the opposite: ta'tha right and ta'tha left and, etc\dots For the upper body, the arms are bent, and on the up beat, they reach into the heart, pulling out cobwebs and laughy-taffy\textemdash on the down step they pull it out, releasing it to the sides, opening up the ribcage and heart more and more.

The last two measures are already an echo. As with all else in this book, whatever works and we'll probably be doing it differently ourselves by the time you read this, if we're even still breathing at all.

\chapter{Chants that are More Complex}

\lettrine[lines=3, lraise=0.1, nindent=.2em, slope=-.5em]{W}{ay back when this hymnal was first written} we didn't have a specific \emph{target market}. Not by any means. And here you are with this artifact in your hands. Maybe the target market was unique. This hymnal was create solely for you to find. It could be that I am you in a past incarnation. All praises due to the one who does not exist! Aim not to be discouraged by rhythms, melodies or music that seem overwhelmingly complex. Simply laugh at the opportunity to be humbled and enjoy the ignorance while it lasts. With persistance, taken in small bites, all of the following are fairly easy to digest.

\section{Om Ganesha Eleggua}

\index{Ifá}
\index{Rivka}
A few months previous to our beginning to assemble this hymnal, Rivka was wondering why we're going all these Hindu chants and none from other cultures. We're into the Afro-Cuban culture and I've been interested in \textbf{Ifá} for two decades. We actually have a small collection of Santería books that I found in our front yard in Hoboken years ago. They're written in Spanish so reading it takes an hour a page, but I stubbornly cling to them. \par

Ifá and Santería are closely related. African slaves weren't allowed to practice their religions here in the Americas. For the most part they weren't allowed to play their own music, speak their own language, or dance the dances of their homeland and in many (if not most) cases, families were separated. We need to keep this in mind when we compare Blacks to other immigrant populations.

\index{Lopes Valdez}
\index{Cuban Academy of Sciences}
\index{Yorùbá}

Ifá is the religion of the Yorùbá people of south western Nigeria, and according to Lopes Valdez, Ethnologist from the Cuban Academy of Sciences, ``The number of slaves landing alive in Cuba [mostly during the 1800s] was about 1.3 million, almost one tenth of all slaves in the Americas. \ldots The Yoruba people were the second major ethnic group brought to Cuba from Africa (behind the Bantu)."
\index{oriṣa}

In Santería, also called Regla de Ocha, parallels were found between Ifá and Christianity, and the Oriṣa---what we might describe as Ifá deities---were worshipped in the form of their Christian counterparts. Obatala was worshipped in the form of Christ, Yemaya in the form of Mary. Those who practiced Santería were able to have their shrines in public, while the practice of Ifá was done in secret.

One of the things we sacrificed in moving to Pensacola from the NYC area was the rich culture of the Metropolitan area.

Within a week of Rivka and my conversation, Peace D Cashmire mentioned that an African Dance class in the Yorùbá or Ifá tradition was beginning the next day, which ended up leading us to Iya Monife Osun's Golden Harvest Ilè, which is an Ifá temple right here in Pensacola.

\index{Eşu}
\index{oriṣa}
\index{Ganesha}
When first learning about \textbf{Ganesha} (\saha{गणेश}), the Elephant-headed deity of Hinduism, I was struck by the parallels to \textbf{Elegua}, who is the divine messenger in Ifá. They are both invoked at the beginning of ritual and seen as openers of the door between worlds; rational and intuitive, physical and spiritual, magical and mundane. They are also both seem as tricksters and I love how Awo Fá'lokun Fatunmbi puts it: ``this role has the function of transforming deceptive and limited visions of self and world." Identified by various names, Elegua is  the name I learned for this oriṣa from the Latin people in New York. \textbf{Elegba} is the name the folks at Golden Harvest and Ileṣa Ire (more on them later) use and in Nigeria, the divine messenger is referred to as \textbf{Eşu}.

\index{Awo Fá'lokun Fatunmbi}
According to Awo Fá'lokun Fatunmbi, one of the twenty one \emph{roads} of Eşu is called \textbf{Eşu Elegbara}, a warrior and the divine messenger of power. He suggests that it makes sense that in an atmosphere of slavery, an aspect of Eşu that represents communication in the face of overwhelming obstacles would become the face of interaction between human consciousness and Spirit.

\index{Sean Johnson}
\index{Shiva}
\index{Pārvatī}
\index{Pārvatī}
\index{Eşu}
Ganeşa, one of the best-known deities in Hindu tradition, is pictured with the head of an elephant, riding on a mouse. Ganeşa is the child of Shiva and Pārvatī and as Sean Johnson tells it, the head was a replacement, following Shiva having torn the babies human head off in a destructive moment of misunderstanding. The playful Ganeşa removes and also places objects along our path in order to guide us in the direction of our destiny.

As both Eşu and Ganeşa are real, it makes sense that they might run into each other, which is what happens in this chant. I can imagine them meeting up in Egypt\textemdash half way between India and Nigeria.

In the first section of this chant, we establish the challenge: finding truth or in Sanskrit, \textbf{Sat} (\saha{सत्}). Then we ask Elegua and Ganesha to please open the door to it. The following section is a traditional Ifá chant. In a presentation of the music of Liberation Theology --- a justice-oriented approach to Christianity which grew out of Catholic Activism in Central America --- composer Nick Page describes the meaning of \textbf{Iba Orisha Iba Layé O} as ``giving Aṣé, the fundamental energy to everyone present''. \textbf{Aṣé} is spiritual energy and might be compared to the Sanskrit word \textbf{śakti} (\saha{शक्ति}). \textbf{Iba} means \emph{I give reverence} and \textbf{Layé O} refers to the power of Spirit. Next we add a series of responses, \textbf{Y'ago} which sounds like, \textbf{eh, ah-go} translates as ``yield'' and means ``Please hear me. Allow this prayer to enter.''. And specifically ask this of Elegba (the American variation), Ganesha and \textbf{Egungun}, which means our ancestors. Lastly a call and response of Aṣé and Aṣé-o which mean, ``so mote it be.'', as well as referring to cosmic, spiritual energy and power. 

There could also be references to \textbf{Mo'juba}, which is a spiritually energizing prayer. It's meaning is \emph{we give reverence to}. Like the Ong Namo Guro Dev Namo chant, we like to do this one with a Rhumba rhythm where every six beats are divided: middle---rest---high---rest---low---low.

At a ``Community Kirtan" at URU Yoga, our friend Garrett Pengle started chanting \textbf{Wahe Guru, Sat Nam}, which basically means Wow Teacher, True Identity. \textbf{Wahe Guru} is the phrase that we morphed into ``Wow is my teacher", giving the name to the Temple of Wow. \textbf{Sat} is \emph{truth} and \textbf{nam} is \emph{identity}. As the chant went on, we started playing some chords with it and the chanting developed into this simple melody:

Someone could just be saying ``Satanam!", another ``Guru sat nam", and so on. Dynamic variation like beginning with whispering the words, building up to a climax, maybe drop down again, etc\ldots.


\section{Gayatri Mantra}
\index{mantra}
\index{manas}
\index{Ra}
\index{Egypt}
\index{etiology}

The syllables of the sanskrit word \textbf{mantra} (\saha{मंत्र}) can be broken up into \textbf{man} (\saha{मन्}): the root of \textbf{manas} (\saha{मनस्}) which means \emph{mind} or \emph{think}, and \textbf{tra} (\saha{त्र}): \emph{vehicle} or \emph{instrument}, making mantra a \emph{vehicle into the mind}. Tra is also translated as ``the heat of life." This is not an etymological dissection of the word. More of an etiology. A way of using the parts of the word to talk about it. There's also \textbf{Ra} with the sun god from Egyptian pantheon, so bring him into our mantra as well.

\index{Sarasvatī}
\index{Indra}
\index{Rand Hicks}
\index{Rigveda}
\index{Vedic}
\index{stanza}
\mna{The \textbf{Vedic} period refers to a time between 1500 and 500 BCE, during which ancient scriptures or were written in sanskrit. \textbf{Véda} (\saha{वेद}) means \emph{knowledge}.}

The Gayatri Mantra is found in the Rigveda which is a collection of ancient \textbf{Vedic} hymns. Gayatri was this milk maid, in  Hindu mythology who wasn't down with it when the god Indra came to fetch her to become Brahma's bride because Brahma was afraid his wife Sarasvatī wouldn't arrive on time for a \emph{very important} ceremony. Sarasvatī was pissed and reigned down punishments on all involved, except Gayatri, whom she eventually befriended and honored with the role of teaching humankind the art of mantra. Below is what was described to me as the ``long" version. Interestingly I read somewhere that the ``short" version preceded the ``long" version, historically. Rand Hicks says that the first two stanzas below (the first half of the mantra) are basically setting the stage for the actual Guyatri Mantra, which begins with the syllable, ``tat", on the second syllable of the third stanza (line of music). Beginning at the syllable, ``tat", the common translation is: ``Let us meditate on the excellent glory of that divine being who illumines everything. May he guide our understanding." It's unfortunate that the \emph{divine being} referred to is masculine.

\index{chakra}
The first half of the mantra walks through various aspects of existence, through the chakras. \textbf{Bhur} is the earth, and is chanted at the root chakra. \textbf{Bhugaha} is life energy, prana or pure vitality at the naval. \textbf{Swaha}---the realm of the divine mind (which is not, at least in this system, the same as higher consciousness)---we invoke at the solar plexus. \textbf{Maha} means \emph{great} and it is chanted at the heart, and may refer to the ``first spiritual region beyond the sun". We then invoke \textbf{janaha}, which is \emph{delight}, at the throat. \textbf{Tapaha} refers to concentration, which we invoke at the First Eye and may be associated with ``the Realm of highest spiritual understanding while still identified with individual existence". The final setting of the foundation for the mantra, Om \textbf{satyam} or \emph{truth} and one more Om prior to beginning the original mantra.

\section{A Long Road}
Once on a drive up to visit my sister Carrie at college in Connecticut, I chanted this chant for a really long time and it stuck around. It was a period of heartbreak and redefinition. Never could quite figure out what the time signature or exact rhythm was, but this is a fair approximation.

\section{I Surrender}
\index{BKS Iyengar}

\mna{\textbf{Bhakti}, the \emph{yoga of devotion} often includes chant and dance. Translations include \emph{attachment, participation, fondness for, homage, faith, love} and \emph{devotion}.}

Many of these chants, like the following, have fairly generic, simple melodies. Melodies that are basically inherent in the words themselves. Prior to leading a weekly 90 minute \textbf{bhakti yoga} class, my nose started getting runny, so I did a headstand, which\textemdash after about 5 to 10 minutes can get the nose settled for an hour or so at least. I'm not sure why. Maybe Iyengar knows. Someone\textemdash I think it was Rivka\textemdash said he mentions the technique in \underline{Light on Yoga}.

\index{Lynn Jackson}

This ``I surrender" chant felt great upside down, a position that revealed a thin layer of lint or something on the floor. Sweeping and chanting are a great combination. By the top of the hour it looked like the class was going to be a no show. I picked up the accordion, still surrendering. Lynn Jackson, a fellow \textbf{bhakti} (\saha{भक्ति}) practitioner showed up and we continued for about 30 minutes. It was great. After a while we started developing the text so that we could include the names of various deities and eventually we were also substituting the pronoun ``I" for the adjective ``sweet", making it ``Sweet Surrender".

The first word, \textbf{Kul}, meaning \emph{All}, is pronounced like the English word \emph{cull}. \textbf{Hayom}, meaning \emph{the day}, is Ha\textemdash Yo + mmm. \textbf{Vikhul} is pronounced ``vi", like the beginning of ``sit" and ``khul", which starts with a consonant sound that doesn't exist in English. The \textsc{kh} sound is generated by vibrating the epiglottis against the back of the tongue the way one might when totally exasperated. It's almost a soft gargling sound. The \textsc{ul} in Vikhul rhymes with ``skull" and the word means \emph{and all}, \textbf{vi} being \emph{and}. \textbf{Laila} means \emph{night} and \textbf{halaila} is \emph{the night}, pronounced Hah\textemdash Lie\textemdash Luh.


For some harmonic variety, and E Major chord \writechord{E} can be substituted for the first \writechord{Cmi} chord or two. The (\writechord{Bb}) minor chord (\writechord{Bbmi}) can also be substituted with a G minor chord (\writechord{Gmi}) and the \emph{dominant} \writechord{G7} chord can be thrown in, leading back to the C minor tonic.

\index{raga}
\index{Hindu}
The following chant is one we learned from a couple of Brooklyn-born Indian Classical musicians, Jagadisha and Harish who came down from West Virginia at the last minute and performed at Pensacola's Mahabhuta Yoga Festival. Garrett Pengle remembered an approximation of the melody which I transcribed and ultimately corrected very significantly after having tracked Jagadisha down through the place in West Virginia that he teaches meditation. He explained that the particular \textbf{raga} that the piece is composed in is called the \textbf{Shivaranjani Raga}, which means \emph{Shiva's favorite}. \textbf{Shiva} (\saha{शिव}) is the fierce Hindu deity associated with consciousness. Simplistically, in the North Indian Hindustani music tradition (as well as the South Indian Karnatic tradition) a raga is a series of pitches along the lines of what Western music calls a scale. The Shivaranjani Raga uses five notes\textemdash no 4th and no 7th; a minor 3rd, and the rest correspond loosely with our minor scale: 1, 2 3\flat, 5 and 6 . Westerners refer to a five note scale as pentatonic (pantagon, pentagram, etc). The tones of the raga each have spiritual significance. The tones of this raga have syllables associated with them: \textbf{Sa Re Ga Pa Dha} and the \emph{upper} \textbf{Sa}, an octave higher.

\index{twelve tone system}
\index{even tempered}
Doing this raga within the \emph{even tempered} Western twelve tone system, we lose the original relationships between the scale tones, which are derived from the natural harmonic spectrum, but this is the system most of our instruments are tuned to, and it is still pretty fulfilling.

\index{Jagidisha}
The story of the birth of this chant, Jagidisha explains, is that it literally ``came out of Harishes tampura. We were living in an ashram. I was very young. Life was chaotic. Every Sunday we played music. Tuning the tanpura and little melody emerged. I happened to play the melody of raga shivanandani and the words just came. There it was. The chant reflects the philosophy, he says, returning back to first part after Shivaranjani has peaked at a very fast tempo. Beyond language; beyond tradition; sound is universal.

\index{Om Nava Shivaya}
\index{Shiva}
\index{namaḥ}
\index{Om}
``\textbf{Shivaya Nama Om} is the ancient and popular \textbf{Om Nava Shivaya} chant done in \emph{reverse}." According to Wikipedia, \textbf{oṁ namaḥ śivāya} (\saha{ॐ नमः शिवाय}) is one of the most important mantra in the 2500 year old Hindu sect, \textbf{Shaivism}: a sect that believes \textbf{Shiva} is the most important Hindu god. Om is the sound of the universe being born. \textbf{Namaḥ} means to bow. Shiva (the destroyer---and creator) is a wild, fierce-tempered god of consciousness.

\textbf{Citi-śakti} is The \emph{power (potential) of consciousness} and the \emph{omniscient all pervading intelligent consciousness} combined: The \emph{power of higher awareness}; The \emph{innate energy} (\textbf{śakti}) surrounding and supporting \emph{consciousness} (\textbf{cit}); The \emph{conscious power}; The \emph{fruition} or \emph{activation} of the \emph{universal absolute consciousness potential}. It is the \emph{potenized union of consciousness and energy} such as in Siva/Sakti; purusa/prakrti; Brahman/Maya; undifferentiated and differentiated consciousness; etc\dots.

\index{Anandamayi Ma}
The chant starts really slowly. A dirge honoring and evolking the great mystic \textbf{Anandamayi Ma}.

\index{Wikipedia}
\textbf{Anandamayi Ma} (Bengali: {\mangalfont आनंदमयी मा}) from Bengal, India is described as a spiritual genius and a Self/God-realized master. She lived between April 30th, 1896 and August 27th, 1982 . The following is taken from Wikipedia: Sivananda Sarasvatī of the Divine Life Society described her as ``the most perfect flower the Indian soil has produced." Precognition, faith healing and other miracles were attributed to her by her followers. Paramhansa Yogananda translates Anandamayi as ``joy-permeated". This name was given to her by her devotees in the 1920s to describe what they saw as her habitual state of divine joy and bliss.

\index{kirtan}
In her twenties, she self-initiated. As she described it, the inner guru dictated the mantra and the inner disciple recited. Apparently at \textbf{kirtans} she would reach intense states of ecstatic bliss.

\textbf{Bandha} \saha{बन्ध} is a Sanskrit word meaning to bind or fasten. \textbf{Mulabandha} is what we in the west call ``root lock"\textemdash a drawing together of the \textbf{muladhara chakra}. It's performed by pulling in and up on the rectum and sex organ and is beneficial for the organs in the lower abdominal and pelvic area. In the front, it can be practiced by stopping your pee in mid-stream. The rectal engagement is the same action we do when we ``pinch off" our excretion.
This bandha is ubiquitous in kundalini kriyas at least as lead by Ravi Singh and his lineage. At one point Rivka and I worked on a song that included the first lyric of this chant, but never quite worked. The theme and it's melody and feel stuck around through the years and fit in perfectly when combined with some Sat Nam and Kula Kundalini up and down the column of chakras.

\textbf{Kālī}\textemdash also known as \textbf{Kālikā} (\saha{कालिका}) is probably the most notorious of the Hindu pantheon with her jet-black skin and necklace of human heads. The destroyer. Mother of the universe. In Wikipedia it says that she is one of the ten \textbf{Mahavidyas}, a list which combines \textbf{Sakta} (a Goddess-oriented Hindu tradition) and \textbf{Buddhist} goddesses.

This chant is to invoke her transformative nature. There cannot be creation without destruction. Transformation is the union of both. The mantra means, ``I bow my head to the Goddess Kali".

(repeat) Kah\textemdash lee\textemdash kah\textemdash yei (like ``lie"). Nah\textemdash mah\textemdash hah. I have also read that the vowel sound in ``yei" is supposed to be pronounced like ``yeah", and that ``you better not mess up the pronunciation of the name" of the Dark Mother. So fair warning. \par
On further digging, as far as the ``yea" and ``yei" we find added to the end of words in sanskrit mantra, it appears that there are eight \textbf{kaaraks}, which take care of the words like in, of, for, hey, to etc\dots. The ``yea" is masculine, used as a suffix on masculine concepts, and ``yei" is used with feminine. My understanding is that the suffix in this case means ``for". I still like my original misunderstanding that the ``yea" a ``yei" change the meaning of the word to invoke the utter essence of the concept to which it is applied. By nature, dieties are \emph{essential} anyway, aren't they? \par
In the same thread that shone some light on the kaaraks, someone mentioned jyotish, which means the ``science of light" and is the vedic study and practice of astrology. In the Vedic system, every letter is said to confirm to a definite pattern of sound. ``Ya" can also mean joining or attaining, so it is a positive concept. The number of syllables is very significant in jyotish science, so some of these ``ya"s may be included to increase the potency of a mantra from that angle.

Shangó is the Yoruba deity of lightening and thunder. Similarly to the Hindu Shiva and Norse Odin and Thor, Shangó is fierce as can be. A warrior. Sometimes we use this chant in yoga when we're doing Virabhadrasana (warrior) poses. In one of his more famous ``roads" or ``incarnations", before Shangó was a god, he was a human being; a king. At some point he committed some horrible act of rage and destruction. As an act of repentance for what he had done, Shangó hung himself from a tree (sound familiar, fans of Odin?) and died. \emph{Ọba so} is Yoruba for \emph{the king hung}. Seeing this fearless act of selflessness and ultimate sacrifice, the creator, Olodumare resurrected Shangó as a deity. Thus the famous saying, ``Ọba kò so": The king did not hang.

I bow to the divine teacher within.} This version of it is to a \textbf{rhumba} rhythm, which comes out of the Afro-cuban tradition and has, through Spain, made it's way to the eastern reaches of Europe where you can hear ``gypsy rhumba".

Yes, it's a vowel followed by six consonants. I like to chant it while aiming for \textbf{hanumanasana}, the forward ``split" representing \textbf{Hanuman's} mighty leap from the south of India to the Himalayas to retrieve the herbs needed for an emergency treatment of severe wounds \textbf{Rama’s} brother, \textbf{Laksmana} incurred battling a vile demon king. Hanuman's devotion to Rama is symbolized in the story from the Ramayana in which he is given a beautiful necklace studded with diamonds. He looks at all the diamonds and tears them out of the necklace, throwing each away, explaining the behaviour by stating that ``anything that does not contain Rama is without worth." When asked if Hanuman himself contains Rama, he tears open his heart and reveals Rama and his consort Sita. This is an odd chant. Not sure if it ``works", but it sticks with me. Rivka says, ``Once you know it, sometimes a weird chant works."

When I ran some of this content by Kiran Paranjape who offers Sanskrit translation services, he says that the proper word to use in this application would be \textbf{wikasa} (\saha{विकास}): ``revealing/opening" as in ``lotus flower opens up to reveal itself". Feel free to substitute that for ujjṛmbh. I am kind of attached to ujjṛmbh at this point, and like that the rolling `r' requires a large amount of air to keep the tongue vibrating against the roof of the mouth.

This chant is of course inspired by the famous soap maker, Dr. Bronner who's ``All-in-one" soap was produced specifically as a distribution mechanism for the scripture on the bottles. When we first recorded the chant for the \underline{Naad Your Heart} album, Emilio (Zef) started doing the following series of gestures, or \textbf{mudrās}.

The following chant---at least in majickal terms---is an incantation to cultivate the 
\emph{divine feminine}. The first three terms are considered \textbf{seed syllables}  or \textbf{bījākṣara} (\saha{बीजाक्षर}), pronounced Bee---jAk---shkah---rah, and often simply referred to just by the term \emph{bīja} (\saha{बीज}), meaning \emph{seed}. The corresponding Japanese and Chinese words are \textbf{shuji} (種子) \textbf{zhǒng zǐ} (种子). The \textbf{bīja}---a term common to both Hinduism and Buddhism---don't have a specific literal meaning, but are known to vibrate sympathetically with certain universal principals, or what Jung might have called \emph{archetypes}. We have enjoyed this chant with a drone as well as \emph{a capella} (sung without instrumental accompaniment). One of the interesting aspects of the movement is that the downbeat falls on the second time the word One is said, but the mudrā happens on the first ``One'', so the movements occur in between downbeats, or on the odd measures, creating two interlocking cycles. 


\mna{Theorized by Swiss psychiatrist and psychotherapist \textbf{Carl Jung}, \emph{archetypes} are \emph{universal}, archaic \emph{patterns}, \emph{images} and \emph{symbols} common to dreams, cosmologies and folk tales of cultures around the world.}

Om (\saha{ॐ}) is the most well-known and possibly most fundamental bīja, signifying the sound of the universe beginning and also the frequency at which it continues to vibrate (432 Hz or around a C$\sharp$). In all three of the syllables, the vowel sound is ``eee'', like in ``cream''. \textbf{Hrīṁ} (\saha{ह्रीं}) engages the \textbf{para śakti} and \textbf{hrit padma}. \par

\index{Sarasvatī}
Para śakti is the power or energy of unmanifest speech. \textbf{Śakti} (\saha{शक्ति}) is feminine and is \emph{energy}. The goddess Lakṣmī (\saha{लक्ष्मी}) who is the fundamental female figure in Hindu theology, is the energy of the universe. It is through her manifestation as Sarasvatī (\saha{सरस्वती}) that this \emph{śakti} comes to us. \par

\index{kriyā}
Hrit padma is the heart chakra. \textbf{Padma} in both the male (\saha{पद्म}) and female (\saha{पद्}) form means `lotus' and also `temple'. The flowering temple of the heart. \textbf{Shrīṃ} is the bīja of \textbf{kriyā śakti} which is the power of \emph{manifestation}, also associated with Lakṣmī (\saha{लक्ष्मी}). \textbf{Kriyā} actually translates as \emph{action} or \emph{deed} and comes from the root word `to do'. In kundalini yoga, the various sequences of movements, words and visualizations are known as \textbf{kriyā}. \textbf{Klīṃ} is a bīja of \emph{attraction}, used to magnify the mantra surrounding it.  \par
\index{parama}
\index{param}
\index{àṣẹ}
We engage the heart chakra---Anāhatacakra (\saha{अनाहतचक्र})---and the power of unmanifest speech; then engage the power of manifestation itself, and magnify these potencies with the Klīṃ bīja. And with these potencies engaged, we invoke the divine feminine: Īśvari \saha{ईश्वरी}; the feminine form of \textbf{Īśvara} (\saha{ईश्वर}), which is a word found in Patanjali's Yogasutras as the fifth niyama, \textbf{īśvarapraṇidhāna} (\saha{ईश्वरप्रणिधान}) or \emph{surrender} to the \emph{divine}; one of the the Eight Limbs of Yoga. \textbf{Parama} (\saha{परम}) means ``supreme", or ``highest", and I have read that we are allowed to drop the last A without changing it's meaning, and \emph{also} that Param means ``other", ``beyond", ``other side". \textbf{Svāhā} (\saha{स्वाहा})---also common to both Hinduism and Buddhism (chi. 薩婆訶 sà pó hē, jp. sowaka, tibetan \texttibetan{སྭཱཧཱ་})---might be translated as ``I evoke", ``so be it" or simply as ``well said". Svāhā could be compared to the Yuruba word, \textbf{àṣẹ}. Àṣẹ refers to the power to make things happen and produce change. Svāhā, a feminine word, is also the name of a ``minor goddess'' in the Hindu pantheon, She is the daughter of Daksha (\saha{दक्ष}), which I guess would make her a sister of Shiva's consort, Pārvatī (\saha{पार्वती}); sum of all consciousness. \par

In the Kula sect, who see no ultimate distinction between Shiva and śakti, this chant is also used to unite with Shiva. Svāhā Shiva (\saha{शिव}). Svāhā Svāhā. Svāhā Parvati. Àṣẹ.

Om is associated with the 1st Eye, between the brow. \textbf{Eim} is the bījā for the energy of \textbf{jnana śakti}, or intellectual energy.
\textbf{Hrīṃ} is the bījā for Para Śakti, unmanifest speech, and the \textbf{hrīt padma} or heart chakra. \textbf{Śrīṃ} is the bījā for \textbf{kriya śakti} — or the power of manifestation, ruled by Lakṣmī. \textbf{Klīṃ} is a bījā of attraction, which amplifies the sounds around it. \textbf{Saw} is a kundalini-activating syllable relating to the relationship betweeen the heart and 1st eye.

The chords look complex at a glance, but it's fairly simple. You can just play B$\flat$ and D with an F note below them for the \writechord{Bb/F} chord, then move the F down one note to E which makes the \writechord{Bbsus/E}. The D minor over F is just moving the E up one and the B$\flat$ one down to A. \par

\index{Adam Powers}
\textbf{Cis} refers to people who people who identify as the gender they were told they were when they were born. \textbf{Adam Powers} is author of a hilarious article on polyamory titled, ``The Only Poly People You’ll Ever Date''.
We wondered how the local yoga community would receive Rivka's gender fluidity, or anyone else's (including mine should I ever chose to ``come out"). We have read about the Hijras, who in Pakistan and Bangladesh are legally recognized as a third gender. So we did a little bit of research and came upon the androgynous deity Ardhanarishvara (Sanskrit: \saha{अर्धनारीश्वर}, Ardhanārīśvara), who is the incarnate union of Shiva and Parvati; The synthesis of soul and nature, masculine and feminine, Purusha and Prakriti. \par
\index{Iya Monifay}
Ifá also has an androgynous deity: Olokun is part mermaid, part man, and resides in the deepest, darkest, unknowable depths of the ocean. Not to confuse gender with sexuality, but Iya Monifay, who is in her late eighties, expressed concern that there is so much homophobia in the spiritual community. ``God looks at the spirit", she said, ``and  couldn't care less about your sexual preference." 

We had been looking for a mantra for the cultivation of androgyny. It's a prefect chant for a time when we are, as a society, in recovery from what Adam Powers so eloquently referred to as the ``cis virus".

\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Another translation of the last line, Bhavam Bhavani Sahitam Namami is 
\emph{I Bow to Shiva and Śakti Together}. Bhavani as the Power to Exist is a potent conceptualization and especially apropos within a society which is trying to deny the existence of a third gender, or anything at all that doesn't fit into our simplistic and erroneous binary gender system.

The Aramaic alphabet is what replaced a previous set of glyphs for \emph{writing} Hebrew.

Current folk lore holds that the word \emph{Abracadabra} derives from a Hebrew or Aramaic phrase meaning ``I create as I speak'' or ``It came to pass as it was spoken.'' There is some conflicting thought on this. The Hebrew phrase, Evra K'divra apparently translates, ``I create as is the spoken word''.

Thomas Ashley Ferrand describes \textbf{Lakṣmī} as the feminine aspect of \textbf{Narayana}, who created the universe. Lakṣmī is a goddess of abundance. Rand Hicks explained that she is a goddess who appears later in Indian culture, less known or worshipped and with fewer stories than, for example \textbf{Sarasvatī}, who is the goddess of learning and through whom mantra came to humankind. According to Ferrand, it is through Sarasvatī that we are able to know Lakṣmī. With this mantra we invoke the manifestation power of Lakṣmī. \textbf{Shrīṃ} is the seed syllable for the power of \emph{manifestation}. \textbf{Svaha} is an invokation.

Pronunciation: Aah\textemdash om Śrīṃ Lax \textemdash mee\textemdash yei (like eye) Swa \textemdash ha. We do it with a swing feel so that on the eighth notes, the first gets around twice the length as the second. This is a musical device that most definitely came into the American musical landscape through the people of Africa. What is does is create a secondary rhythmic layer within which there are cycles of three and four co-mingling, giving the ears and logical mind more to latch onto and be carried away -- or inward by. This same piece of music could be written with 12 eight notes to the measure as opposed to four quarter notes. In the following version of it, each of four downbeats in the measure gets divided into three, making twelve. This allows a subdivision of \emph{three} sets of \emph{four} as well.

Namaḥ is a salute, whereas Svaha is an invocation.\par
The chant is to cultivate the celestial healer within (and around) oneself. Ferrand describes the type of person whom simply being in their vicinity brings feelings of inner peace and wellbeing.

\chapter{The Devi Mahatyama }

\index{Durgā}
\index{Hindu}
\lettrine[lines=3, lraise=0.1, nindent=.2em, slope=-.5em]{T}{he Devi Mahatyama} is a hymn to the divine feminine and specifically the Hindu Goddess, \textbf{Durgā} (\saha{दुर्गा}), pronounced \emph{duur\textemdash gaa}. The \textbf{Devi Mahatyama}\textemdash a cornerstone text of goddess tradition\textemdash is part of a larger work, \textbf{Devi Gita}, which means Song of the Goddess, and itself which is a part of the the \textbf{S'rîmad Devî Bhâgawatam} (also known as the Devi Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavatam), which is classic Hindu sacred text.

Rand hicks used the phrase ``The Difficult One" to describe Durgā. She is super-bad. The story of her birth\textemdash as I read it\textemdash is that a demon performed a great spiritual ritual and became wildly powerful. Demons attacked the Celestial Beings and drove them into hiding (as ascetics and monks among humankind). After some research a large group of 30 Celestials including Indra, Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma and Parvati lit a huge fire and sang and danced and performed sacrifices (including sacrificing the ego) for many days. Finally a being formed who contained their combined knowledge and powers. The great and fearsome Durgā has a beautiful and benevolent face, but in her arms brandishes many weapons. A handful of Parvati's magical herbal concoction blown into the fire forms the tiger upon which Durgā rides. 

She makes it known that though she is \em{of} the celestials, she does not \em{belong} to them and following their ernest entreats, easily dispatches of the demons. It is to Durgā that we might chant for protection.

A translation: Hail to the Goddess, the Great Goddess; to the Auspicious One always hail! 
Hail to Nature, to the Propitious One; we humble ourselves before her continuously.
