Normally stackinset is used to place things
\stackinset{c}{}{c}{}{$\bullet$}{inside} of a specified object.

However, there is nothing to prevent it from placing things
\stackinset{c}{.3in}{c}{.5in}{$\bullet$}{outside} of it.

When placed with respect to a null point, usage can be successive, 
as in the void at the end of this sentence.\smash{%
\stackinset{c}{.3in}{c}{.3in}{NE}{}%
\stackinset{c}{-.3in}{c}{.3in}{NW}{}%
\stackinset{c}{-.3in}{c}{-.3in}{SW}{}%
\stackinset{c}{.3in}{c}{-.3in}{SE}{}%
}

But if placement is with respect to a finite sized anchor, usage must be nested:

\stackinset{c}{}{c}{.3in}{12}{%
\stackinset{c}{}{c}{-.3in}{6}{%
\stackinset{c}{-.3in}{c}{}{9}{%
\stackinset{c}{.3in}{c}{}{3}{%
\scalebox{19}{\rule{0ex}{1.17ex}$\circ$}%
}}}}
\end{document}
