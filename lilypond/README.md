## Faitheist Hymnal Version II ##

Note I used the songidx program to render the song index. 

Documentation is [here](http://songs.sourceforge.net/songsdoc).

Lilypond is the rendering engine with XeLateX.

Main file, `hymnal.latex` uses Arara commands, and I add a couple of other commands to `render.sh` which is the main file to render the entire hymnal.
